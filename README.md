# nDmontecarlo
This program evaluates a multi-dimensional integration using the Monte Carlo method. 
It can numerically evaluate the integration of a function f(x1, x2, ... xn) in (a[i],b[i]), i=[1,n] limits by area comparison. 
It does so by generating arbitrary random points within a rectangular shape surrounding the function.
